# Georgia Southern University

This repository contains the LaTeX template for the masters thesis required by the College of Graduate Studies.

### Disclaimer:
This document is my interpretation of the official guideline provided by the College of Graduate Studies at Georgia Southern University. I do not represent, nor am I affiliated with any decision making in the process of getting a Master's thesis approved.

The official site provides only Microsoft Words based templates and I faced some challenges when I decided to write the whole document in LaTeX. Once I got my Master's thesis approved, I decided to share my LaTeX preamble with as much detail as I could to provide a starting point for anyone else trying to do as I did.

I welcome pull requests for any changes or improvements. I admit this isn't cleanest LaTeX document and I am still trying to learn how to convert this into a template.
